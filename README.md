Concretely, it shows 
- how to generate new categorical, and dummy variables,
- how to choose the best subset of features for the prediction,
- how PCA, K-means clustering, K-best techniques can be used to prepare data for modelling,
- how to compare classifier's results in an efficient way, and define the best classificator for the dataset,
- how to search between hyperparameters, and find the best set of parameter values for a classifier,
- how to use cross-validation to evaluate the model in the most accurate and realistic way,
- how to visualize results of the estimation.
